# Staking-contract

Overview
The Staking Contract allows users to stake their ERC-20 tokens, earn rewards, and withdraw their staked amount along with accumulated rewards. The contract implements essential staking functionality, including reward accrual based on time, owner-controlled parameters, and emergency withdrawal features.

The contract is deployed on a testnet using thirdweb.com and interacted with through MetaMask.
